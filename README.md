My name is Paulo. I am a "Bachiller en Ciencias con menciÃ³n en IngenierÃ­a Civil" and I live in Peru. I love traveling, food, biking and swimming. I'm currently training as a Backend Developer because I'm passionate about programming! :smile:

During my training as a backend developer, I am contributing my work I do from the course in my repository so that I can serve those who want to embark on this beautiful experience of programming. :eyeglasses::zap:

Feel free to message me, will be happy to answer you! :sunglasses:
